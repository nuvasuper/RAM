# RAM

If experiencing problems opening/running RAM:
1.  in Ureal Engine, File->Refresh Visual Studio Project
    This should reload some files that are needed to run the project, but cannot be synced over Github.
2.  Make sure you have the Unreal Engine 4.8 Standard Assets. 
    Those aren't synced because they shouldn't change over time.
3.  If that doesn't work, tell me about it, that one's new to me.
